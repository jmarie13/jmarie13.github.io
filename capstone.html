        <h3>SNHU Capstone</h3>
        <p><strong>I aim to showcase a diverse set of skills with three major enhancements aligned with the course outcomes.</strong></p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvZC0_Yi2_8" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Code Review</a>
        <p><strong>Code Translation: C++ to Python</strong>First, I will transfer a project from C++ to Python, highlighting my proficiency in both programming languages. This enhancement showcases my ability to refactor and translate code while maintaining functionality and performance. Additionally, it demonstrates my understanding of modularity and separation of concerns, which are essential principles in software design. By doing so, I illustrate my capability to design and evaluate computing solutions across different languages, applying algorithmic principles and computing standards, thus aligning with the course outcomes related to design and evaluation, as well as the use of innovative techniques and tools.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jmarie13/Capstone/tree/Python-Translation" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Enhancement One Repository</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Data Structure Optimization</h3>
        <p>Second, I will improve the efficiency of the project by optimizing data structures. This involves implementing more efficient algorithms and utilizing advanced data structures, such as Python's `Counter` module, to enhance data handling and processing. This enhancement not only shows my proficiency in selecting and using appropriate data structures but also my ability to optimize algorithms for better performance. These skills are crucial for solving complex problems in computing, demonstrating my ability to design and evaluate solutions while managing trade-offs effectively. This aligns with the course outcomes of applying algorithmic principles and using innovative techniques in computing practices.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jmarie13/Capstone/tree/Optimized-Data-Structure" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Enhancement Two Repository</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Database Integration</h3>
        <p>Third, I will integrate the project with a MySQL database, demonstrating my proficiency in designing, creating, and managing databases. This includes writing SQL queries to interact with the database, which is essential for data persistence and retrieval. By integrating the software application with a database, I enhance the project's functionality and data management capabilities. This demonstrates my ability to design and implement database solutions that complement software applications, aligning with the course outcomes of designing and evaluating computing solutions and using industry-relevant tools.</p>
         <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jmarie13/Capstone/tree/MySQL-Support" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Enhancement Three Repository</a>
        </p>
        <p>My exploration of algorithms and data structures extended into the realm of reinforcement learning. In the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) Agent project, I worked on fine-tuning hyperparameters and implementing an early stopping mechanism that ensured the model's efficiency. By monitoring metrics such as loss, win count, and win rate, I was able to assess the effectiveness of the learning process and make adjustments to improve the agent's performance.</p>
        <p>Outside of my ePortfolio, I tackled the Cartpole Problem using reinforcement learning techniques. This project involved modifying exploration factors, discount factors, and learning rates to optimize the algorithm's performance. Through iterative experimentation, I gained a deeper understanding of how these parameters influence the model's behavior, which enhanced my problem-solving skills.</p>
