            <h2>Dear Hiring Manager,</h2>
            <p>
                As a recent summa cum laude graduate in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University, I am excited to re-enter the workforce in data management and technology. My journey, while unconventional, has uniquely equipped me with a broad range of skills, a proven resilience, and the adaptability required in fast-paced, changing environments. With 15 years as a military spouse, I’ve thrived through seven relocations and balanced family life with entrepreneurial ventures, managing a small business and overcoming challenges with resourcefulness and focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background includes significant experience in project management, organization, and navigating the complexities of frequent relocations while developing technical and analytical skills essential for a career in tech. My commitment to returning to the workforce in a technology role has been reinforced by my recent achievements, including completing my degree under challenging conditions. This journey has taught me persistence, meticulous attention to detail, and an ability to handle diverse responsibilities with composure—qualities I’m eager to bring to your team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sincerely,<br>
                Jennifer Gonzalez
