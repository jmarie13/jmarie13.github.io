<p>Throughout my time at SNHU, I have learned several important skills in the field of computer science that I will carry with me into my future career. Although I had some coding experience from obtaining my associates in computer programming from Augusta Technical College and spending some time in an on-campus environment at Augusta University, my classes here have introduced me to new languages, concepts, and tactics that I may not have come across otherwise. Some of the most important, and most enjoyable, topics I learned about were MongoDB (databases), algorithms, code security, and data structures. These areas are also key to a successful career since they are critical to writing industry-standard code.</p>

<p>Doing so ensures all parties are involved in the process of developing a system and can provide the best quality final product.</p>

<h3 id="data-structures-and-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms:</h3>
<p>Throughout my education I have learned several critical concepts to writing code. Using the knowledge gained from CS260 Data Structures and Algorithms I’ve learned the importance of structuring applications appropriately, using efficient storage methods, and using efficient algorithms in order to reduce memory overhead of applications. I have also learned about the complexity and different timings of vector, hash tables, binary search trees, and when it is best to use each one. Understanding the design and functionality of various data structures allows me to pick and choose which ones I feel are best suited to my applications scope and allows me to tailor my code to run more efficiently.</p>

<p>My artifact comes from the CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms course at SNHU. In its simplest terms the project loads a bids csv file and can then do several small tasks such as display all of the data, find a predetermined item from the data, or delete the predetermined item from the data. However, none of the data is stored, and upon close, nothing is saved.</p>
