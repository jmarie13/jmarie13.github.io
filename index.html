            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, I’m Jennifer Gonzalez, a recent summa cum laude graduate in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University. My path to tech has been anything but conventional, but that’s what makes it exciting! With a background in project management, organization, and a strong analytical mindset, I’ve developed the adaptability and problem-solving skills essential in fast-paced environments.</p>
            <p>Before diving into the tech world, I spent 15 years as a military spouse, navigating seven relocations while balancing family life and entrepreneurial ventures. Managing a small business while continuously learning and refining my technical skills has taught me resilience, resourcefulness, and a passion for tackling new challenges</p>
            <p>Beyond my professional ambitions, I’m an avid runner, hiker, reader, and writer—activities that keep me curious, energized, and always striving to grow. I believe that the best professionals are lifelong learners, which is why I’m always seeking out new opportunities to expand my knowledge in data management, analytics, and technology.</p>
            <p>I’m excited to bring my skills, dedication, and passion for learning to a team that values innovation and problem-solving. Thanks for stopping by my portfolio—I hope it gives you a glimpse into both my professional journey and the person behind the resume!</p>   
            <p>Beyond this project, I have consistently applied software engineering best practices across my work. In projects not included in my ePortfolio, I have employed principles like separation of concerns and modularity. For instance, in one project, I utilized the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern to decouple database access from the business logic, leading to more maintainable and testable code. These experiences reflect my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.</p>
