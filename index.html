        <h3>Personal Self-Assessment</h3>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Throughout my journey in software engineering and data science, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, data structures, and databases. My work reflects a deep understanding of software design principles, effective problem-solving, and continuous learning. This journey has not only equipped me with a diverse set of technical skills but also solidified my passion for solving complex problems and contributing meaningfully to the tech industry.</p>
        <p>The rigorous curriculum, coupled with hands-on projects, has provided me with the opportunity to hone my skills in various areas. These experiences have helped me refine my professional goals, particularly my aspiration to become a Data Engineer. The challenges I faced in optimizing data structures, enhancing software design, and integrating databases have been instrumental in preparing me for the technical demands of the field. Moreover, the emphasis on ethical considerations, especially in areas like security and privacy, has shaped my professional values, ensuring that I approach every problem with a mindset geared toward responsible and secure computing practices.</p>
        <p>Working on various projects throughout my program has also highlighted the importance of collaboration and communication. Whether it was teaming up with classmates on group assignments or presenting my work to stakeholders, these experiences have enhanced my ability to work effectively in a team environment. I have learned how to communicate technical concepts clearly and concisely, ensuring that both technical and non-technical stakeholders understand the impact and value of my work. This skill is crucial for a successful career in computer science, where teamwork and clear communication often determine the success of a project.</p>
        
        <h3>Software Engineering and Design:</h3>
        <p>One of the most significant projects in my ePortfolio is the CornerGrocer, which I successfully migrated from C++ to Python. This project involved optimizing data structures by leveraging Python's collections.Counter, which enhanced both performance and simplicity. Additionally, I integrated MySQL database support, which improved scalability and data management. For example, I developed functions to fetch data from the database, allowing the program to display frequency lists and histograms with ease.</p>   
        <p>Beyond this project, I have consistently applied software engineering best practices across my work. In projects not included in my ePortfolio, I have employed principles like separation of concerns and modularity. For instance, in one project, I utilized the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern to decouple database access from the business logic, leading to more maintainable and testable code. These experiences reflect my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.</p>
        
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures:</h3>
        <p>One of the cornerstones of my education has been the study of data structures and algorithms. The ability to select and implement the right data structure or algorithm for a given problem is a fundamental skill in computer science, and my coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in this area. Through projects like the CornerGrocer, I have applied these principles to optimize performance and ensure that my solutions are both efficient and scalable. This experience has reinforced the importance of algorithmic thinking in solving complex problems, a skill that is directly aligned with my career goals in data engineering.</p>
        
        <p>My exploration of algorithms and data structures extended into the realm of reinforcement learning. In the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) Agent project, I worked on fine-tuning hyperparameters and implementing an early stopping mechanism that ensured the model's efficiency. By monitoring metrics such as loss, win count, and win rate, I was able to assess the effectiveness of the learning process and make adjustments to improve the agent's performance.</p>
        <p>Outside of my ePortfolio, I tackled the Cartpole Problem using reinforcement learning techniques. This project involved modifying exploration factors, discount factors, and learning rates to optimize the algorithm's performance. Through iterative experimentation, I gained a deeper understanding of how these parameters influence the model's behavior, which enhanced my problem-solving skills.</p>
        <h3>Databases:</h3>
        <p>My passion for databases is evident in the enhancements I made to the CornerGrocer project. By integrating MySQL database support, I enabled data persistence across multiple executions, which was crucial for handling larger datasets. I also created a SQL script to automate the creation of the database and tables, further streamlining the project's setup process.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Security has also been a recurring theme throughout my studies, emphasizing the need for vigilance in protecting sensitive data and ensuring the integrity of software applications. I have taken proactive steps to improve database security in my work. For example, I transitioned from using a JSON file for database credentials to employing environment variables. This change not only enhanced security but also demonstrated my ability to adapt and implement best practices. This focus on security aligns with my professional values and my commitment to developing software that protects users and their data.</p>
        <p>This ePortfolio is a testament to the diverse range of skills and knowledge I have acquired during my time at SNHU. Together, they paint a comprehensive picture of my talents and readiness to contribute to the tech industry as a Data Engineer.</p>
